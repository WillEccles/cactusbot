# Cactusbot

A simple discord bot that does some stuff.

This bot is controlled by [cactuscontroller](https://github.com/willeccles/cactuscontroller).

## Todo:

- [x] Implement a second bot that lives in my personal server (and isn't allowed to join other guilds) that listens for me to make commands, which would be used to control cactusbot remotely without using ssh/vnc each time. This would have options to shutdown, restart, update, and maybe even dump the last 2000 characters worth of output from the bot.
- [ ] Reorganize code to make it cleaner in some areas.
